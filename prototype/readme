i want to build a prototype for a new app.
The app will be a barber shop booking system.
The prototype will include the following features:
- user can schedule a haircut or a barber session
- can view day and available times as well as professionals
- other core features that you can think of

the system will have a dark theme, but like a dark gray and a orange in a way
that goes good together, you can pick the exact colors but go in this line
your goal is to make all in one .html file, the app, and javascript and css,
write a summary after that about your changes
The app must be mobile first, but also compatible with desktop
